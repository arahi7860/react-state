# React Lifting Up State

## Learning Objectives
- Learn how to lift state up from a component.

## The World's Tiniest Social Media App

Our goal today is to make a miniscule application where we can submit a name, and an image, and have it pop up in your navbar, with a helpful greeting! In doing so, we'll learn about why we "lift state".

Parent components do not know about the states of their child components, and child components do not know the states of their siblings, so if we ever want to have information mutually shared between components, we must "lift state" to the parent component. Let's start with the structure of the app.

## File Structure

Create a new React app in the sandbox folder with the name `byte`.

```sh
➜ npx create-react-app byte
➜ cd byte
➜ code .
```

Replace the contents of your `App.js` with the following:

```jsx
import './App.css';

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="app">Hello!</div>
  )
}

export default App;
```

Replace the contents of your `App.css` with the following:

```css
nav {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 10px;
  width: 100vw;
  display: flex;
  font-family: monospace;
  border-bottom: 1px solid black;
}

form {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: center;
  margin: 0 auto;
  font-family: monospace;
}

label, input {
  font-family: monospace;
  width: 200px;
}

img {
  border-radius: 100%;
  width: 25px;
  height: 25px;
}
```

Great! Let's get started with the function of the app:

## We Do: Create the Navbar

Create a new file called `Navbar.jsx`. Fill it with the following code:

```jsx
function Navbar(props) {
  console.log(props);
  return (
    <nav>
      <h4>Hello, user!</h4>
      <img src="" alt=""/>
    </nav>
  )
}

export default Navbar;
```

## You Do: Create The Login Form

Create a new file called `Login.jsx`. Fill it with the following code:

```jsx
function Login(props) {
  console.log(props);
  return (
    <form>
      <input type="text" name="username" />
      <input type="text" name="imageURL" />
    </form>
  );
}

export default Login;
```

Import and render this comoponent in `App`, so you can test it in real time. From here on:
1. Add a new `useState` hook for the username, and one for the imageURL. (Remember the getter and setter!).
1. Add an `onChange` event to each input to update their respective state.
1. Add the corresponding `value` for each input.
1. Create a `handleSubmit` function that prevents the default behavior (page submitting with query parameters) `console.log`s 'submitted!'.
1. Add an `onSubmit` event to the form to trigger the `handleSubmit`.

## Communication Breakdown

Now we have a simple nav bar and form! However, if we want to send the information from `Login` to `Navbar`, we'll have to "lift state".

Let's make a new state in `App` to store the username and information in an object! We'll then pass its setter as prop to `Login`, and its getter as prop to `Navbar`.

In App.js:

```jsx
import { useState } from 'react';

function App() {
  const [userInfo, setUserInfo] = useState({});

  return (
    <div>
      <Navbar userInfo={userInfo} />
      <Login setUserInfo={setUserInfo}  />
    </div>
  )
}

export default App;
```

Now that we can store our user's info in `App`, let's implement the setter in `Login`.

```jsx
import { useState } from 'react';

function Login(props) {
  const [username, setUsername] = useState('');
  const [imageURL, setImageURL] = useState('');

  const handleSubmit = (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    props.setUserInfo({
      username,
      imageURL,
    });
    setUsername('');
    setImageURL('');
  }

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <input type="text" name="username" value={username} onChange={(e) => setUsername(e.target.value)}/>
      <input type="text" name="imageURL" value={imageURL} onChange={(e) => setImageURL(e.target.value) }/>
    </form>
  );
}

export default Login;
```

If we now take a look in React DevTools, we can see that the `userInfo` state in `App` has been filled!

Finally, let's use the `userInfo` prop in `Navbar`. This time, since we have multiple props, let's destructure them out.

```jsx
function Navbar(props) {
  /* 
  * this is the same as using props.imageURL or props.username
  * otherwise you would have to do:
  * const imageURL = props.imageURL;
  * const username = props.username;
  */
  const { imageURL, username } = props;
  return (
    <nav>
      <h4>Hello, {username}!</h4>
      <img src={imageURL} alt=""/>
    </nav>
  )
}
```

And there we have it! Our navbar now displays the username and profile picture of our user!

## Closing

By creating a state in `App` that we can manipulate and access from other components, we're able to keep mutually necessary information accessible to other parts of the app. This is one approach to lifting state, but there are many others! For another good example, take a look at the [Intro to React](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html#lifting-state-up) tutorial! It uses class components, but the principles are component type agnostic.
