# Hooks: `useState`

In this section, we'll cover the simplest hook, `useState`, and how it can be used to store and update information.

To get started, we'll dive into the counter example from the main Readme, going through it line-by-line.

```jsx
function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)

  const increment = () => setCount(count + 1)
  const decrement = () => setCount(count - 1)

  return (
    <div>
      <span>Current Count: ${count}</span>
      <button onClick={increment}>+</button>
      <button onClick={decrement}>-</button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Tuples

```javascript
const [count, setCount] = useState(0)
```

The first thing we notice here is the `const [count, setCount] = ...`. If this syntax is unfamiliar, we are simply using [ES6 Array Destructuring](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment). `useState` returns an array with two items: the first is the value of the state, and the second is a function you can use to update that state, triggering a re-render. The above could be rewritten as:

```javascript
const countState = useState(0);
const count = countState[0];
const setCount = countState[1];
```

Typically, we use arrays for storing a list of values. We often don't know what the length of that array will be. In this case, we know that `useState` will *always return an array of two items*, the first being the state, and the second being the updating function (this follows the [_getter_ and _setter_ paradigm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutator_method#JavaScript)).

When an array is used this way, it is known as a `tuple`. A tuple is an array of a fixed length, with each entry in the array representing a particular value. Tuples are not often used within the JS community, but React Hooks have introduced them, and you'll likely be seeing them used in more and more libraries moving forward. The important thing to remember that _a tuple is just an array_. 

Here's an example of an address as both an object and as a tuple:

```javascript
const addressObject = {
  line1: '123 Sesame Street',
  line2: 'Unit ABC',
  city: 'New York',
  state: 'NY',
  zip: '10001'
}

const addressTuple = [
  '123 Sesame Street',
  'Unit ABC',
  'New York',
  'NY',
  '10001'
]
```

Often, it makes more sense to use an object to represent data, because the keys describe what that value is. With Tuples, developers need to know & remember what each entry in the tuple is. For example, would you rather come across `address[3]` or `address.state` when reading through code? Often, objects make the most sense. But, in combination with ES6 Array Destructuring, tuples have one advantage - we can easily assign each value to a variable of whatever name we choose.

For our address example, a tuple might be handy if we are working with various APIs that use different variable names. Maybe we are submitting the address to an api that uses all-uppercase properties - in that case, we could do something like this:

```js
const [LINE_1, LINE_2, CITY, STATE, ZIP] = address

api.updateAddress({ LINE_1, LINE_2, CITY, STATE, ZIP })
```


When working with `useState`, this means we can assign the state and and our updater function to whatever we choose:

```js
const [username, setUsername] = useState('joseph')
const [zipCode, setZipCode] = useState(90065)
```

## Initial State

Back to this line:

```js
const [count, setCount] = useState(0)
```

We see that we call `useState` with a value of `0`. This argument is the initial state - in this example, `count` will be assigned to `0`.

## Calling the update function

Moving on to the next two lines:

```js
const increment = () => setCount(count + 1)
const decrement = () => setCount(count - 1)
```

Here, we are creating two new functions that will call `setCount`. These functions are then assigned to the buttons as handlers:

```jsx
return (
  <div>
    <span>Current Count: ${count}</span>
    <button onClick={increment}>+</button>
    <button onClick={decrement}>-</button>
  </div>
)
```

When we click the `+` button, the `increment` function is called, which executes `setCount(count + 1)`. When `setCount` has been called, the component will re-render, and our `count` will have been increased by one:

```js
const [count, setCount] = useState(0) /* same as before, except useState will return an updated count */
```

So, when an update function is called, *the new state will be whatever was supplied to that function*. This sounds pretty straightforward (and it is!) - but this works a little differently from Class components. Keep this in the back of your mind during the exercise, and we'll cover it in the next section.

### Exercise 1: Clicker Hook

1. Create a new React app called `counter`. Replace the contents of App with the above example. 
2. Play with the initial state. 
3. (bonus) Prevent the count from going below 0 or above 10.
4. (bonus) Disable the `+` button when the count is 10, and the `-` button when the count is 0. (hint: you can disable a button HTML element with the `disabled` prop: `<button disabled={true}>...</button>`)

## Multiple Hooks & Multiple pieces of state 

Ok, let's beef up our Counter component. In addition to tracking the `count`, we want to add a controlled text input, and keep track of that value in the state.

When we use the setCount function provided by useState (or any set function such as setInput, setBanana, etc.), the updated state is not merged, but replaced completely. So, if we were to rewrite the above component like this:

```jsx
function Counter() {
  const [counterState, setCounterState] = useState({
    count: 0,
    inputValue: ''
  })

  const increment = () => setCounterState({ count: counterState.count + 1 })
  const decrement = () => setCounterState({ count: counterState.count - 1 })
  const handleChange = (e) => setCounterState({ inputValue: e.target.value })

  return (
    <div>
      <span>Current Count: ${counterState.count}</span>
      <button onClick={increment}>+</button>
      <button onClick={decrement}>-</button>
      <input onChange={handleChange} value={counterState.inputValue} />
    </div>
  )
}
```

When we call the `increment` function, our component will re-render, and our `counterState` will now look like:


```js
{
  count: 1
}
```

The `inputValue` is no longer on the state! You *could* merge in the existing state each time you call `setCounterState`, like so:

```js
const increment = () => setCounterState({
  ...counterState,                 // spread in the existing state
  count: counterState.count + 1    // update the count, overwriting the existing count
})
```

But, this will quickly become cumbersome as we add more pieces of state. In this case, we can simply call `useState` twice: once for our count, and once for our input value:

```js
function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)
  const [inputValue, setInputValue] = useState('')

  const increment = () => setCount(count + 1)
  const decrement = () => setCount(count - 1)
  const handleChange = (e) => setInputValue(e.target.value)

  return (
    <div>
      <span>Current Count: ${count}</span>
      <button onClick={increment}>+</button>
      <button onClick={decrement}>-</button>
      <input onChange={handleChange} value={inputValue} />
    </div>
  )
}
```

Much simpler! üëè

We can call `useState` as many times as we need.

## Summary

That's it for `useState`! It's super simple, and great for tracking basic pieces of your state.
